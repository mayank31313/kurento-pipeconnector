### External Kurento Image Procesing Adaptor

This project uses OpenCV and ZMQ, to process and apply OpenCV Algorithms on kurento media pipeline. I know by doing this it makes kurento media server a bit more tricky, but its easy to apply machine learning algorithms in python than in C/C++, also it makes easier to balance the workload across devices.
